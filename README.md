# Clicky Game
Clicky Game is a memory game app. The app renders different images to the page. Each image is clickable.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

The app keeps track of users' score. The users' score increments when clicking an image for the first time. 

The users' score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once, and the game restarts.
